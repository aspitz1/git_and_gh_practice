# Travel Experience
One of my favorite trips was to a trip to the North Rim of The Grand Canyon.
I got really lucky to snag a camping spot last minute. My partner drove from
Missouri to Arizona for a 4 night camping trip. It was the most magical
experience. We had never been that far west before so all the geology was
exciting. The Canyon was spectacular. Honestly my favorite thing about the trip
was the rainbows that seemed to come out of the rock formations.
