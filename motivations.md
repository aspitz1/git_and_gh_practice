# Motivation to Change Career
I quite my last career, Tattooing, about 3ish years ago. I was really burnt out
with everything that comes with being self-employed. I was also sure I was not
going to maintain the physical demands. I was experiencing over use injuries that
where not getting better with treatment. There where some other reasons too, but
those two where big ones. I spent up until 6 months ago really unsure of what to
do next. I knew I didn't want to work in the Commercial Art field any longer. I
tried some different things. Nothing really felt right til I started
doing some coding on my own.

Learning about code is really exciting for me. I'm excited to get up everyday and
learn more! It fills my need to learn and be challenged. Coding is creative in its
own way and I really like that.
